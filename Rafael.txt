In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not 
a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of 
worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, 
sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to 
eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means 
comfort.
...
“Good Morning!” said Bilbo, and he meant 
it. The sun was shining, and the grass was very 
green. But Gandalf looked at him from under 
long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than 
the brim of his shady hat. 

“What do you mean?” he said. “Do you wish 
me a good morning, or mean that it is a good 
morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel 
good this morning; or that it is a morning to be 
good on?” 

“All of them at once,” said Bilbo. “And a very 
fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors, 
into the bargain. If you have a pipe about you, 
sit down and have a fill of mine! There’s no 
hurry, we have all the day before us!” Then Bilbo 
sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his 
legs, and blew out a beautiful grey ring of 
smoke that sailed up into the air without 
breaking and floated away over The Hill.
